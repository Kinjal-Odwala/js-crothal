			<h1>Salary & Wages</h1>
			<div class="description">The <b>Salary & Wages</b> module allows the end users to review and modifiy the payroll entries 
				if necessary via the Daily Payroll Approval functionality. End users can also manage the pay codes available for use 
				when recording weekly payroll details per employee.</br></br>
				The main features of the Salary & Wages module are as follows.
				<ul>
					<li>If the end user selects to review an entry within a closed/future pay period, the records cannot be modified.</li>
					<li>If the end user selects to review an entry within the current pay period that has already been Approved and Posted,
				 		the record cannot be modified unless an end user with appropriate permissions unlocks the record.</li>
					<li>End user overrides an incorrect time or adds a missed punch and provides the correct date and time. 
						The system recalculates the gross hours based on the new date and time. If the end user does not want 
						the system to automatically subtract an unpaid lunch period from the employee's gross hours, 
						as identified on the House Code setup screen, the employee clears the Lunch option.</li>
					<li>For House Codes using Time and Attendance, the end user needs the ability to specify which pay code is the 
						default pay code, as Regular does not always apply. If a default pay code is already defined, the current choice 
						would override the previous selection.</li>
					<li>When a House Code does use Time and Attendance, entries are typically imported from the Kronos application and are 
						then reviewed and modified if necessary via the Daily Payroll Approval functionality.</li>
					<li>For House Codes using Time and Attendance, punches from the timeclock(s) are transferred to TeamFin based on an established schedule.</li>
					<li>When a House Code does not use Time and Attendance, entries are made using the Weekly Payroll functionality.</li>					
					<li>Hours cannot be entered if Payroll is being processed, the Salary and Wages module will be appropriately locked down.</li>
					<li>End users can also manage the pay codes available for use when recording weekly payroll details per employee.  
						Pay codes can be associated with an individual, a specific shift or all employees.</li>
					<li>The Daily Payroll Approval functionality does allow for the entry of productive pay codes. 
						Once an individual's time for the day has been approved, it is then visible through the
						Weekly Payroll mechanism. Those who use Time and Attendance can add/modify non-productive hours and 
						dollar differentials via the Weekly Payroll mechanism but they cannot modify productive hours via the Weekly Payroll screen.
					</li>
