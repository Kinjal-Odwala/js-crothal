			<h1>Invoicing / AR</h1>
			<div class="description">The <b>Invoicing / AR</b> module allows end user to create, print, collect and credit invoices.
				An invoice is considered complete when the total collected equals the total of the invoice.</br></br>
				Sales tax will be calculated either at House Code or Job level. Sales tax line item will be added for Job 
				if it is configured as Override Site Tax in House Codes --> Jobs setup (find the tax rate based on the Job address details) 
				else sales tax line item will be added for House Code (find the tax rate based on the Site address details).</br></br>
				It also allows the user to create a description invoice line item (Account Code "0000") that would print on the invoice. 
				Description line item will not be included in the calculation such as the sales tax, subtotal and total.
